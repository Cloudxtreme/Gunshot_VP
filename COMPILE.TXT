Step 0) Assumptions:

	The first assumption is that you have Borland Pascal installed in C:\BP.  
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDBP.BAT file

	The second assumption is that you have Virtual Pascal installed in C:\vp21.
	If you don't, you'll have to update the BUILDVP.BAT file

	*NOTE* The BUILD*.BAT files will copy a BPC.CFG or VPC.CFG into the relevant bin directory, meaning
	if you have cusomized the .CFG file in the bin directory, it will be lost.  Make a backup!

Step 1) Create directories to hold everything:

	Z:\Gunshot
	Z:\Programming\Gunshot\EXE\BP
	Z:\Programming\Gunshot\EXE\VP
	Z:\Programming\Gunshot

	If you don't have a Z: drive, you can use SUBST or map a network drive to fake one
	You can also put the files in an alternate location if you want, you'll just have to update the BUILD*.BAT scripts

Step 2) Get the source

	Check out the GIT contents into Z:\Programming\Gunshot

Step 3) Get Async Professional for DOS v2.03

	Not sure where you'll find this since the company doesn't exist anymore, but if you're interested enough I'm sure
	you'll be able to find it somewhere.  Once you do, extract it to Z:\Programming\Gunshot\APRO
	
Step 4) Build new EXEs

	Run BUILDBP.BAT to build the DOS EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Gunshot

	Run BUILDVP.BAT to build the WIN32 EXEs and have them copied to Z:\Gunshot
