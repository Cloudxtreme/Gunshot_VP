Notes from Chapter 4 of the Virtual Pascal 2.1 User Guide: Compatibility with Borland Pascal and Delphi

I've put a + next to the ones that are relevant, and a - next to the ones that are probably not.

+ All Integer and Word type parameters to standard procedures and 
  functions as well as function return values of these types have been 
  extended to Longint.

  For this reason, the Use32 unit should always be included in the uses 
  clause before trying to recompile 16-bit code written with Borland 
  Pascal. If it is not, variable parameters of types Word and Integer 
  will cause Type mismatch errors when compiling.
  
  To ease this process, the compiler can be instructed to implicitly 
  include the Use32 unit in the uses clause by specifying the 
  {&Use32+} state.
  
  When using {&Use32+} to include the Use32 unit implicitly, it is 
  possible to revert to the original 16-bit integer types by including the 
  Use16 unit in the uses clause.  This unit simply reverts the changes 
  done by the Use32 unit. 
  [ All instances of Word and Integer in RECORDs should have been converted 
    to SmallWord and SmallInt now.  Also TYPE instances of "of Word" and
    "of Integer" should have been similarly converted.
    Still REETODO: Weird cases like doing a BlockRead() with Word or Integer ]

- The Mark and Release real mode procedures are not implemented. 
  [ Don't appear to have been used, luckily! ]

+ Since VP operates with a flat 32-bit memory model as opposed to a 
  16:16 bit segmented one, the Ptr function accepts only one argument, 
  Offset.  

  Two new procedures for converting between 16:16 and 0:32 pointer 
  types, SelToFlat and FlatToSel have been added.
  [ Any place Ptr() is being used likely needs to be rewritten anyway ]

+ Two new 16-bit integer types, SmallInt and SmallWord are introduced.

+ Three new variables supplementing FileMode are defined: 
  FileModeReadWrite, which is used when using ReWrite on a typed or 
  untyped file instead of FileMode, TextModeRead, used when Reset is 
  used on a file of type Text, and TextModeReadWrite, used when 
  ReWrite is used on a file of type Text.  The file mode variables are all 
  declared as threadvar and can safely be used in multi-threaded 
  programs. 
  [ Still REETODO to investigate whether this needs changing anywhere ]

+ The Sound and NoSound procedures are not implemented; the VP 
  procedure PlaySound implements a combination of both. 
  [ Sound() can potentially be replaced with Windows.Beep -- I found that
    Windows.Beep didn't work for short durations though, I recommend >= 200ms ]

+ Procedures specific to the DOS operating system (Intr, MsDos, 
  GetCBreak, SetCBreak, Keep, GetIntVec and SetIntVec) are not 
  implemented. 

+ The built-in assembler of VP supports all 386, 486 and Pentium 
  instructions. Assembler code written for Borland Pascal or 16-bit Delphi 
  should be rewritten to 32 bit
  [ As with Ptr(), ASM bits likely need to be rewritten anyway ]

+ The Inline procedure defined by Borland Pascal, where numbers 
  representing machine code language can be entered directly, is not 
  supported.

+ VP generates very efficient for loop code. However, after the loop has 
  terminated, the value of the FOR control variable is 1 greater than the 
  maximum bound. Programs should not rely on the value of a for 
  control variable outside the for loop.
  [ I know at least one instance where this is a problem -- not sure what the 
    easiest way to find other instances will be, but it's a REETODO item ]

+ Case statements cause more efficient code to be generated. As opposed 
  to Borland Pascal, VP does not allow overlapping case selectors.
